# Super Galactic Age Calculator
#### JavaScript and Node based html project used to determine an individual's age on other planets as well as their life expectancy, 3-16-18  

#### _By Stephanie Faber_  

## Description
_This is a project designed to take a user input of a birth date and calculate their age on another planet, such as Mars. The project will also display the user's life expectancy._  

## Specifications

1. User enters their birth date into the page.
* Example input: User enters 12/12/1992
* Example output: The value of that date is stored

2. The input date is converted into seconds.
* Example input: date of 12/12/1992 stored in js datetime format, date of today
* Example output: use getTime() to return milliseconds, divide by 1000 to return seconds.

3. Take seconds of user input and todays date and subtract them to determine age in seconds.
* Example input: todaysDateInSeconds - usersDateInSeconds
* Example output: usersAgeInSeconds

4. Convert seconds to years. There are roughly 31,536,000 seconds in a year on Earth.
* Example input: usersAgeInSeconds/31536000
* Example output: usersAgeInYearsEarth

5. Convert age in years (25.27 in this example) on Earth to years on another planet, like Mars.
* Example input: usersAgeInYearsEarth/1.88 (25.27/1.88)
* Example output: You are 13.44 years old on Mars

6. User enters the age of their life expectancy on Earth. Convert it to the age on another planet, for example Mars.
* Example input: My age expectancy is 83 years.
* Example output: That would be 43.7 years on Mars.

7. Determine if difference between users age and age of life expectancy. Return years left on that planet, for example Mars.
* Example input: Your age on Mars is 13.44 years, and you expect to live until you are 43.7 Martian years old.
* Example output: You have 30.26 Martian years left.

8. Should user's age exceed the given life expectancy, return the number of years they have exceeded that life expectancy.
* Example input: Your age on Mars is 45.89 years, and you expect to live until you are 43.7 Martian years old.
* Example output: You have lived 2.19 Martian years past your expectancy date! Congratulations!
